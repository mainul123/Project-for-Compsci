### Project Description

In this project, we aim to use the designs and techniques we have learned already regarding inverted indices, and expand upon them. We aim to add several features to the functions, including a stemming algorithm, graphs, and word information storage. It is in the realm of possibility that we might add supplementary features, such as formatting in Flask or the deciphering of other file types.
